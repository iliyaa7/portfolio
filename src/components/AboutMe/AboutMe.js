      My name is Tomasz Gajda, I'm a third year Applied Computer Science student at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow. I have been learning Front-End technologies for a year and this time was just enough for me to make sure that this is my place in the industry.

      <br/>
      Membership in the science club developed my design skills, which quickly turned into a new hobby. I am fluent in English (spoken and written) and intermediate Spanish. Apart from designing and programming websites, my passion is all kinds of motorsport - from rallies to the very king of motorsport - formula 1.
